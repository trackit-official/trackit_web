# 🧾 Trackiitt - Backend Implementation Guide

Trackiitt is a finance tracker SaaS implemented with NextJS backend and Mono integration. This guide focuses on backend architecture to ensure robust financial data handling and processing.

---

## 🏗️ API Design Principles

- RESTful endpoints following resource-based naming conventions
- Versioned API routes (`/api/v1/accounts`, `/api/v1/transactions`)
- Consistent response structures with proper status codes
- Rate limiting implementation for security

## 🔗 Mono Integration Architecture

- Secure API key management via environment variables
- Webhook handlers for real-time account updates
- OAuth flow implementation for account linking
- Token refresh and management system

## 🔄 Data Synchronization Layer

- Scheduled jobs using Next.js API routes with cron functionality
- Queue management for high-volume transaction syncing
- Idempotent operations to prevent duplicate transactions
- Conflict resolution strategies for concurrent updates

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Logging

- Structured error responses (status code, message, error ID)
- Centralized error handling middleware
- Detailed logging with appropriate log levels
- Application monitoring integration (Sentry, LogRocket)

## 🔒 Security Implementation

- Data encryption for sensitive financial information
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection on all form submissions
- Rate limiting and request throttling

## 📊 Data Aggregation Services

- Efficient database queries for financial insights
- Caching layer for frequently accessed reports
- Background processing for heavy calculations
- Data normalization for multi-currency handling

## 🚦 Transaction Processing Pipeline

- Validation middleware for incoming transaction data
- Categorization service with machine learning capabilities
- Event-driven architecture for transaction updates
- Batch processing for historical data imports

## 📋 User Preferences & Settings

- Granular permission system for data access
- Feature flag implementation for gradual rollouts
- User-specific configuration storage
- Default settings management

## 🔔 Notification System

- Event-driven notification dispatcher
- Template-based message formatting
- Delivery status tracking
- User-configurable notification preferences

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- Query optimization for large transaction datasets
- Pagination implementation for large result sets
- Database indexing strategy
- Response compression and caching

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for Mono API interactions
- Mocked financial data for development
- CI/CD pipeline integration
