<!-- Add Zod validation section for user inputs -->

## 🛠️ Input Validation with Zod

To ensure robust and type-safe input handling, use Zod schemas for all incoming data. Example for signup and signin:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

// Signup schema
export const signUpSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, "Name must be at least 2 characters"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  password: z
    .string()
    .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters")
    .regex(/[A-Z]/, "Must include an uppercase letter")
    .regex(/[a-z]/, "Must include a lowercase letter")
    .regex(/[0-9]/, "Must include a number"),
});

// Signin schema
export const signInSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  password: z.string().nonempty("Password is required"),
});
```
````

Integrate these schemas in your API routes or form handlers:

```ts
import { signUpSchema } from "@/validation/auth";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const body = await req.json();
  const data = signUpSchema.parse(body);
  // ...proceed with data.name, data.email, data.password
}
```

Use `parse` (throws on error) or `safeParse` (returns success/error) to validate and handle errors gracefully.

```
